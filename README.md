## Optical Character Recognition of Questions in Screenshots and Asking ChatGPT for Answers

The purpose of this tool is to recognize screenshot images that include questions (e.g. multiple choice questions, open-ended questions, etc.), parse the questions, and ask chatGPT for an answer.
This leverages the OpenAI APIs to send along the prompt and immediately return the answer to the user.

This application is currently in alpha development mode (working, barebones prototype).
